        line-1: "After analyzing the description of your project, if I can accompany you, I will send you an email 
        so that we can set up a physical meeting or a videoconference with your tools or mine (probably more 
        adapted since I live near Maastricht, Netherlands)."
        line-2: "During the meeting, we will try to get to know each other better, and then to precisely identify the 
        goals of your project in order to understand or even advise on the functionalities to be developed, 
        how to organize their development, which technologies to use and have a first idea of the visual style for 
        the application if no specifications book exists."
        line-3: "At the end of this meeting, we will determine the next step to take according to the situation. 
        We will be able to decide whether fixed-price or time-based billing is more appropriate for your needs. 
        If no functional and technical specifications exist beforehand, I will propose you elaborate 
        it together (legally required, even with Agile methodology)."

        I strive to be constructive in what I say and provide a great user experience."
        line-3: "I am specialized on the Javascript programming language and prefer to use its backend framework
        Node.js instead of PHP, although I was also a PHP developer (with Symfony, API-Platform or CMS Wordpress)"
